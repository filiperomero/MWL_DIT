Regarding the web task(s) I will be asked to perform (‘web-based activity’), I understand that my behavior will be monitored by means of a piece of software for experimental purposes. This piece of software is aimed at gathering my activity such as clicking, scrolling, mouse movements generated during my interaction with a web-page.The aim of the study is to assess my mental workload imposed by a web-based interactive task.</p>
